    <h1 class="content-page-title-center"> ERASMUS smart home virtualisation</h1>
    <p class="siteTxt">The project goal was to make an game for VR where user could interact with demo room of smart home , meanwhile any
      change in game should translate to the real demo room . We were split into multiple teams competing against each other while
      having regular meetings . My team decided to use Unity , we managed to make an game with clickable items such as turning lights on and turning tv while changing current  
      state of items in real home.  My task was to make script for conneting elements of home to real one which i partially succeded , it only updated states rather
      than first checking current state to update game so it would be real time sync. I also contributed to making LED lights in game using object properties and
      rotating tv animation.
