    <p class="siteTxt">The project goal was to make an game for VR where user could interact with demo room of smart home , meanwhile any
      change in game should translate to the real demo room . We were split into multiple teams competing against each other while
      having regular meetings . My team decided to use Unity , we managed to make an game with clickable items such as turning lights on and turning tv while changing current  
      state of items in real home.
