    <p class="siteTxt">My attempt to build an Cad/CAM for my future CNC


    </p>

 
<p class="siteTxt">
  During my time in SpikeFish, since they didnt had any work to give me they asked me if i have any kind of shortcoming from
   universtiy which i didnt had so i went with my project.
Idea was to make an 2.5D CAD/CAM which could be used wiht my future CNC, the 2.5D comes from layers wihle it would allow user
to draw the desired paths for CNC. It has implemented zooming and panning as well as drawing
lines function. The layers were funcitonal too . However reality is building entire AutoCad singlehandedly in two weeks
is undabutably huge undertaking ,the project attempted to follow MVC strucure but in end got tangeled. Reality is that even if i managed
to get the graphics part fully working turning that into Gcode would have proven to be impossible, i had idea to rely on raster graphics 
and use pixels as points ,but this too would have ended same way.

<h1>Refreshed Dev</h1>
 
<p class="siteTxt">
Since i managed to implement zooming and panning, everytime i see it i kinda whish to finish it . So in response i attempted
to refactor code,but this has led to many features getting broken, also goal was to reduce size of problem by only focusing on lines
first and potentialy use vector like storage for easier turning into Gcode. But in end due to other priorities project was left in the current state.
Layers got broken, line points got broken too (line points allowed editing lines plus starting and connecting lines together).
