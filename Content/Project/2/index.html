    <p class="siteTxt">In this project goal was to make an static site with dynamic js content loading.
      The site consists of few main sites which then use scripts to acces content loading script,
      an content loading script has internal functions to acces the ConfigJson. ConfigJson contains many
      settings including data about max indexes for content folders as well as the metadata json atributes

      
  
</p>

    <p class="siteTxt">
      The content is located in contentGroup folders and uses indexed folders.
      It is also used for dynamic loading of navbar and filters, since they too require configJson they have
      their events setup in same module. Alongside the content loader the component builder module has job of making
      components that will be included to the webpage . Each page has its own group or induvidual script that acces the
      content loader



    and provide necesary data such as relative position to src folder or folder category index. The config json
    has also data abaout classes or ids of components to insert or use .
    </p>
 

    <p class="siteTxt">
      There is also slight optimization to only fetch json once and store it for later use though its only done in js
      variable
      not local storage. In the future there is plan to improve this website by making configJson more organized and
      also store fetched

      data on local storage for performance optimization by removing need for fetching same data.
