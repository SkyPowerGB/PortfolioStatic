    <h1 class="content-page-title-center"> Java Digital simulator</h1>
    <p class="siteTxt">This is a litle project i decided to build while in university. I already was comftorable with
      Swing and Digital
      electronics are just logic so why not.


    </p>

    <p class="siteTxt">
    Originaly it was motivated by idea that i might do some digital electronics with redstone in minecraft in hope of building
    8 bit computer .But designing scheme is hard and not interactive so i kinda got idea to build a simulator in java.
    </p>


    <p class="siteTxt">
    The project works on realtivly simple logic, all components use same class digital component which contains method update . 
    Update method updates output pins based on input ones while wires transfer state from input to output. Project
    builds the buttons for components dinamycally. It also creates components dinamycally as whole app was designed to feature easy addition of new
    components. Component in reality is just an JPanel with texture while pins are buttons, to offset btns and match texture tehre is text file which stores
    pins offsets.
    </p>
    
<p class="siteTxt">
  Overall while the project manages to correctly simulate the circuits in swing worker ,
   the movement and wires proved to be difficult to implement
  so in end project was abandoned. The movement is only most limiting factor in this 
  program as it limits workspace and no abiltiy to move compoents.
Later as i attemped to develop CNC CAM CAD ,i kinda wanted to implement same UI in simulator. .or possibly start from begging since 
code structure could use improvements but so far it didnt happen.
